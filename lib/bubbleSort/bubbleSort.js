/**
 * Standard Bubble Sort
 * Sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that
 * repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent
 * items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list
 * is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
 *
 * Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both Ðž(n^2), where n is the
 * number of items being sorted.
 * @param {Array<*>} array
 * @param {Function} [comparator=naturalComparator]
 * @return {Array<*>}
